#This line of code was fun. In order for the MAR form to fill out correctly, I had to have fillers for the dates existed
#before the medication was started. Example (without this code) if the medication start date waas 7/15/2017, then when the MAR form goes through its loops,
#the first record would be placed under the 1st of the month. This is incorrect since the medication should start on the 15th of the month. 
#to solve this, I created this signal which is fired whenever a new medicationTime is created.
#It (1) gets the startDate of the medication from the medicationTime (2) strips the day from it (3) converts it to an integer (4) checks if the integer (days)
#is greater than 1 (i.e. the first of the month) (5) if it is, then create c - 1 many records to fill the void.
#This allows for the loop to fill in the correct dates with the correct dates in the MAR. Problem solved
#Note, I will probably look back on this in a few months or weeks and think this was a completely stupid way to do this, but it solves my problem at this point.
#One issue, that Celery may be able to solve, is the Model.objects.latest(). This works great if there isonly one person entering medication, but what
#happens if two pepole simultaneously enter different medications? Is it possible person a will get person b's latest medication from the DB (note, the latest is to retrieve
#the most recently created medication. Since the medication kicks off the medicationTime creation signal, and the creation of the medicationTime kicks off this signal,
#then there is a possibility - it seems - that you could have incorrect medication returned. This, again, is only an issue if there is more than one. For 
#carePlus home care plus facilities, it shouldn't be given small size of employee base. If we scale this, though, this code will need to be looked further in to.
